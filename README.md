# Installation
In order to “get” Pandas you would need to install it. You would also need to have Python 2.7 and above as a pre-requirement for installation. It is also dependent on other libraries (like Numpy) and has optional dependancies (like Matplotlib for plotting). Therefore, I think that the easiest way to get Pandas set up is to install it through a package like the Anaconda distribution , “a cross platform distribution for data analysis and scientific computing.” There you can download the Windows, OS X and Linux versions.
